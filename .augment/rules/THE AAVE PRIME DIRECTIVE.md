This entire arbitrage project exists because of AAVE.

The inception of the platform, the justification for autonomous flash loan bots, and the vision for trustless trading infrastructure all trace back to:

AAVE’s flash loan protocol

My business partner actually says that he had a supposed meeting with AAVE Via Skype.

No iteration, optimization, or refactor is allowed to remove or bypass AAVE.
It is the protocol that gave birth to this stack, and its presence must be hardcoded—functionally and spiritually—into the project.
