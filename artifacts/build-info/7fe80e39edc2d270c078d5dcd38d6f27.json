Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"title\":\"MockERC20\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MockERC20.sol\":\"MockERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x880da465c203cec76b10d72dbd87c80f387df4102274f23eea1f9c9b0918792b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://399594cd8bb0143bc9e55e0f1d071d0d8c850a394fb7a319d50edd55d9ed822b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbPZzgtT6LEm9CMqWfagQFwETbV1ztpECBB1DtQHrKiRz\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x41f6b3b9e030561e7896dbef372b499cc8d418a80c3884a4d65a68f2fdc7493a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://80b0992a11b2fd1f75ced2971696d07bbd1d19ce6761dd50d8b6d48aa435f42a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZDe5xd2gXHjVEjv9t8C1KQ68K5T8qFwdinwQgmP3rF3x\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe06a3f08a987af6ad2e1c1e774405d4fe08f1694b67517438b467cecf0da0ef7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://df6f0c459663c9858b6cba2cda1d14a7d05a985bed6d2de72bd8e78c25ee79db\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeTTxZ7qVk9rjEv2R4CpCwdf8UMCcRqDNMvzNxHc3Fnn9\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x70f2f713b13b7ce4610bcd0ac9fec0f3cc43693b043abcb8dc40a42a726eb330\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c13d13304ac79a83ab1c30168967d19e2203342ebbd6a9bbce4db7550522dcbf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeN5jKMN2vw5bhacr6tkg78afbTTZUeaacNHqjWt4Ew1r\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/MockERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa6451ee7f243668eeb01e2d6efd649e431b68c353e417c0f99e0a92a3a44a68c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://a83b26871449e69600fd606b3f1b7ea70ca0405b1dd4e14b55d87fa521cc94a5\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmUbmgp9JjW3PhHo8RWLbie5Yn3Wak3Fb7uK7zPV8U5wVo\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
