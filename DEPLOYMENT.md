# 🚀 ATOM Trading System - Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Quick Fix for Current Issue

The deployment is failing because Vercel can't find Next.js. Here are **3 solutions**:

### **Solution 1: Deploy from Frontend Directory (Recommended)**

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Test build locally
pnpm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### **Solution 2: Deploy from Root with Configuration**

I've created a `vercel.json` in the root directory. Now you can deploy from root:

```bash
# From project root
vercel --prod
```

### **Solution 3: Create New Vercel Project**

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
5. Set **Framework Preset** to `Next.js`
6. Deploy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Next.js version detected"
**Cause**: Vercel is looking in the wrong directory
**Solution**: Use Solution 1 or 2 above

### Issue: Build fails with TypeScript errors
**Cause**: TypeScript compilation errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run type-check
# Fix any errors shown
```

### Issue: "Package manager changed from npm to pnpm"
**Cause**: Previous deployment used npm
**Solution**: This is normal and won't affect deployment

## ✅ Verification Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Check the live URL** - Should show the ATOM Trading System
2. **Test bot controls** - Start/stop buttons should work
3. **Verify real-time updates** - Metrics should update every 3 seconds
4. **Test theme switching** - All 6 themes should work
