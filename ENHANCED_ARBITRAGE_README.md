## üîß Usage Examples

### Execute AAVE Flash Loan Arbitrage

const params = ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(
  ["address", "address", "uint256", "uint8", "uint8", "bytes", "bytes", "uint256", "uint256", "uint256"],
  [
    tokenA,                    // Token A address
    tokenB,                    // Token B address  
    amount,                    // Flash loan amount
    0,                         // Buy DEX (0=Uniswap, 1=SushiSwap, 2=Balancer, 3=Curve)
    2,                         // Sell DEX
    buyData,                   // Buy execution data
    sellData,                  // Sell execution data
    minProfit,                 // Minimum profit required
    maxGasPrice,               // Maximum gas price (gwei)
    estimatedGasUnits          // Estimated gas consumption
  ]
);

await atomArbitrage.executeArbitrage(tokenA, flashLoanAmount, params);
```

### Execute Balancer Flash Loan

```javascript
const tokens = [tokenA];
const amounts = [flashLoanAmount];

await atomArbitrage.executeBalancerFlashLoan(tokens, amounts, params);
```

### Check Gas Cost

```javascript
const gasUnits = 500000;
const gasPriceGwei = 20;

const [acceptable, costUSD] = await atomArbitrage.isGasCostAcceptable(gasUnits, gasPriceGwei);
console.log(`Gas cost: $${costUSD}, Acceptable: ${acceptable}`);
```
